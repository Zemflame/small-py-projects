to play, copy all files to a directory and run either **10wordle_reformat.py** or **11wordle_rewrite.py**

1-9wordle_*.py are old versions of the program.

10wordle is feature complete and presentable dispite being horribly coded.

11wordle is a significantly more optimised and well made version, however it does not have a settings gui and might be unstable (ngl its probably more stable lmao)
